The goal of this project was to create a responsive web app that lets users chain API calls together. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of the approach:

React Components: The app was built using functional components. The main component ApiSequenceBuilder manages the API requests and user inputs.

API Chaining: The application chains two API requests together. First, we fetch user data (e.g., GET /users), then use the fetched userId in a second API call (e.g., POST /posts). The response from the second API call is displayed in real-time.

State Management: The app uses the useState hook for managing the form inputs and API responses.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind classes were used to build a clean, responsive UI with dark mode by default. The layout includes three main sections:

Response section: Displays the API response dynamically.
Design and Responsiveness: The interface is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, utilizing modern design principles and dark mode for better UX.


Assumptions and Decisions
Assumed API Structure: It is assumed that the APIs used for chaining follow a RESTful structure. In the provided example, a simple GET request is made to fetch user data, and a POST request is used to create a new post.

Basic Input Fields: The app includes fields for title and body for the post creation API. Additional fields can be added as needed.

Design Inspiration: The design was inspired by modern UI dashboards with a dark theme, using Tailwind CSS to speed up development and ensure responsiveness.


Completed Features
Functional API Chaining: Successfully chained two APIs (GET followed by POST).
Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works across various screen sizes.
Interactive Inputs: Users can input data dynamically, and the API calls use this data.
Real-time API Response Display: The response from the API is displayed in real-time, formatted for easy readability.
Dark Mode UI: Professional and clean design with dark mode by default.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to log API errors in the console.
